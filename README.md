This is a parser for a grammar for source code defined by Professor Ahmadnia. It is assumed that the source code is a text that has been tokenized and delimited by spaces.

## Files

The [Spreadsheet](Compilers%20final%20doc.ods) defines the grammar and corresponds to the large state table in the parser.
